In Chicago, some traffic lights have, in addition to the
red/orange/green phases, a special pedestrian
crossing indication that changes to walk slightly before
the light turns green and an orange hand that appears
slightly before the main traffic light turns orange.

Design a data-type to capture all of the different
states that the light can take on. (Our solution
has five states; yours should probably too, but if
you think a different number makes more sense, go
for it.) When changing from one state to the next,
either the light color should change or the
walk/donâ€™t-walk status should change, never both.

Write functions to support a big-bang program that
draws a traffic light that cycles appropriately.
