Hamlet
Folger Shakespeare Library
FORTINBRAS Let four captains
Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage,
For he was likely, had he been put on,
To have proved most royal; and for his passage,
The soldier's music and the rite of war
Speak loudly for him.
Take up the bodies. Such a sight as this
Becomes the field but here shows much amiss.
Go, bid the soldiers shoot.
They exit, text from the Folio not found in the Second Quartomarching, after the which, a peal of
ordnance are shot off.text from the Folio not found in the Second Quarto
